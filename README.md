# What is this
This is a siple number generator for bingo games with a "Christmas" color scheme (green and red).

# How to run
This is a Next.JS project. To run dev server: `npm run dev`

# Known issues
When you press the generate button when the board is full, the window freezes.
I simply do not care enough to fix this, so just be careful.
